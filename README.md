Old movie streaming project replica of popcorn Time , uses open source API's to query movie and series torrents , allows users to create accounts and stream these movies / series torrents directly from the angular client.
the client will also download the movies/series in the background as you watch 

A local express JS backend server is used to run the js torrenter and filesystem api
